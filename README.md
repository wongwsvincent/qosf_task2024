# QOSF Mentorship Program 2024 Screening Task
Screening task submission for the [QOSF Mentorship Program](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/)

## Task 1: less than k
### Brief Summary

The attempt to task 1 is in the form a self-contained Jupyter Notebook (`Task1.ipynb`).

First there is a more theoretical part discussing the main concepts of the algorithm, and subsequently the actual code implementation properly commented and explained.

The quantum circuits are built using [Qiskit](ibm.com/quantum/qiskit).

If you have any question or suggestion, feel free to contact me!

Enjoy!üòÅ
